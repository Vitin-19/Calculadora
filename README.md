# Calculadora

This project is a calculator. I created this just for entertainment.
It does the same function of a calculator, calculate everything that you want.
This project is a web one, so I used html, css and JavaScript to make it.
I chose the cyan color because it is one of my favorite colors and the gray to make a contrast with cyan.
To use it, you execute the html file. After opening it, you can click on the keys or use your own keyboard to write you calculation. (Note, if you use want to use the key "()", please select the space between them and use you keyboard. I will fix that after)
This is my fisrt project that I'm posting on GitHub and I'm doing this just for a test, but if you want to rate it, please send me your opinion.
